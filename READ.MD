GAME:	GTA SAN ANDREAS [PS2]
Info:	

---- Intro ----
[NOTES]
* I have 2 Copies of GTASA PS2 and for some reason it is one of the few games i have never ripped to PC
SLES_52541
1. Black		- This is the version in use.
2. Platinum

[Instructions]
** The most important step required to use ALL the ".pnach" cheats provided is also using the save game / save state.
**  Starting a new game with the clean save state ensures the addresses stay the same & then all the cheats will work.
** This is optional but strongly recommended.

1. Use PAL Version "1.03" & Patch PAL version with NTSC 60hz / FPS using "Adrenalin_Patcher.exe"
	* Optional: Upgrade or Convert: but then the save game and cheats will not be compatible...
	* Optional: Modify the Occlusion Files, set to All 0's if using emulator...
** Then rebuild .iso using IMGBurn default settings.

2. Setup PCSX2 Settings FOR GTA:SA
	* Fix Game looks like crap in PCSX2 1.6 		- See Settings image 1.
3. Cheats: 
	a) in-game cheats 
	b) PCSX2: cheats\".pnach" 
	c) cheat engine - ".ct" 
4. Save Game
	a) do not insert the memory card, boot game, watch 1st custscenes until you have control of the game.
	b) Load the save state thus ensuring all cheats in the .pnach work, because addresses will now be the same.  
	** no progress has been made, this simply ensures all addresses for the cheats are the same.
5. Playing the game.
	* Each time you play the game you will need to Load Save State! So after you play for a while, Save Game -> Save State -> Shutdown, reboot, -> Load Save State!
** Did you get that ??? So to re-iterate:  To keep the addresses the same, use save states. Every time you shutdown the emulator and then reoboot and load from the memory card, the addresses will change. So to keep the addresses the same, and to keep a hard memory card of your progress, after you have saved your game normally, ALWAYS make a save state. Then when you start a new game, ALWAYS load the save state. Whilst your playing and have not shtudown the emulator obviously you can solely rely on the in-game save system but you should also be keeping regular save-states anyway, they are better, although they can corrupt from time to time when hammering many codes.

[Notes]
* PS Hardware users obviously cannot use the save state, but they would have to convert cheats to cheat cd format and use that cd anyway.
//... i have considered converting codes to armax cd for both vice city & sa, but that would be after both projects are complete.
* because THERE ARE NO PAL cheat codes made for ".pnach" & i am not going through the same shit i went through with VC.
* SA is simply too big to go through the shit online & with addresses changing every boot that justs it a ridiculous task to do alone. NTSC users had at least 20 people create the codes available, PAL just has me.
* ... if there is no useful, simple, all-in-one documentation on using cheat engine, or modifying GTASA to do everything after 21 years, there never will be and i can guarantee without looking for hours and hours there is not. Vice city proved SA will be the same shit, even worse.
* Because of this i will not be modifying the game or making cheats extensively, even if i wanted to...

[rip & compare] 
* Compare versions
* Create folder of differences, save space, no loss of data.

[Cheats] - Cheats
* In-Game Cheats: Organised.
//... thousands dumped online but not organised, genius method, fail on the upload & organisation.
* .pnach cheats: created.
//... as usual, no pal support, so added what i could, but to use all of them requires starting a clean pal 2004 using the save state provided.

--- TO DO: ----
[Scan Documents] -
* Scan game manuals, inserts, cd, map & BRADYGAMES "Official Strategy Guide".
* ^^ Will not fit in scanner so will use camera or phone, which these days, is pretty good. My 10+ year old 4K Sony phone or Camera will suffice.

[Release]
* Put all the crap together & release with the vc pack.
* save game, save state, cheats.

----  Changelog ----
1. Differences Made 
	- Downgrade PAL  2.01 	-> 	PAL  1.03 		=	1.00 GB 
	- Downgrade NTSC 3.00 	-> 	NTSC 1.03 		=	1.00 GB 
	- Convert PAL 2.01 		->  NTSC  3.00 		=	49.9 MB
	- Total (Compressed):						=	 616 MB	
	- GTASA PAL 2.01 (Compressed):				=	2.36 GB
	
	Total 	(GTA:SA - All)						=	2.96 GB
	* ^^ (All PAL + NTSC Versions, Regions, No duplicates, No Loss Of Data)
	
	Total 	(GTA:SA - JAPAN)					=	2.14 GB
	* ^^ (JAPAN Only)	
	
	Total 	(GTA:VC - All)						=	4.41 GB
	* ^^ (All Versions, Regions, No duplicates, No Loss Of Data)	
	
	Total 	(GTA:VC & SA - All - Double Packed)	=	6.77 GB
		* ^^ (Without GTA:SA Japon)
		
	Total 	(Double Packed + Japan SA)			=	8.91 GB
		* ^^ (All Versions, Regions, No duplicates, No Loss Of Data)
		
	
	Comparison to All .iso  (not compressed)
	vice City 	= 37.9 GB 
	san andreas = 16.8 GB	|| 20.9 GB with Japan Included 
	Both		= 54.7 GB	|| 58.8 GB 
	
	* This means that 60GB compressed (Every GTA:VC & SA .iso, versions & regions untouched) would probably be 30GB+.
		* Pack Saving approx 24GB of space with no loss of data. 
	//... That should make alot less traffic.
	
	Note: "JAPAN SAN_ANDREAS"
	* Unfortunately JAPAN SAN_ANDREAS is significantly different to NTSC/ PAL. The differences (approx.) compressed = 2.14 GB
	* this raises the TOTAL size for All PS2 GTA:VC & SA PS2 Releases to approx. 9GB compared to 6.77GB Without japan SA.
	
2. In-Game Cheats organised
3. .pnach Cheats made.
4. had to re-do the fucking cheats because the addreses change 
5. so now also create clean save game state so the cheats will work for others. - But they'll have to start a new game with that save state ffs!
6. Save state done 
7. new cheats added: instant paramedic, firetruck.


---- The GTA:SA project begins: ----

[Creating the Save Files;-]
* Freeze Mission Timers is a common cheat, but freezing the countdown timer for being outside the vehicle is a new cheat. 
//... This makes vigilante missions with truly infinite time. 45Mins. Could have been alot less with a bit of practice.

[The Save Files:]
1. Clean Starter Save State: No Progress. 
- This allows compatiblity with the New Cheats (.pnach) never been done for PAL 2004 before.
	- it ensures the addresses do not change and that all cheats work.
2. Starter Save file: 
- This is a "regular" save file, not a save state; 
	- CJs garage with DMG proof vehicle, Some cash, weapons, armour etc but no progress made.
		- This is for people who are not going to use ALL cheats in .pnach form 
			- or for console users. - or for users who want to turn dynamic address cheat codes into static, that would be good.

GTA: SA is different to VC and because of this there is no need to do "ALL the 0% complete with all the benefits of 100% save game". 
* I have created new cheat codes that can instantly complete ambulance, firetruck missions, adn the vigilante is just kinda fun to do so instead of auto-complete cheat i added an infinite mission  timer & infinite time outside of vehicle cheat, also the No Wanted Level Stars cheat...

Vice City benefits from them a starter save game with side quests compolete, because it is so janky, empty & frustrating.

** Play Vice City for the story using a perfect pre-made starter save game to avoid of the crap & hassle of extra side quests and low health, crap sprint. 

** Play GTA:SA and just enhance it with this cheats, no premade save required except the Zero Point save state.

Bascially SA is a better designed layout and all round better game, which means cheats are not actually they merely enhance SA, whilst VC practically demands them to make it playable.
