

Unfortunately there is no known code to change the colour of vehicles

i dicovered them for vice city on my own, but SA does not use static addresses and the code is completely different

i have been unable to find the coloour addresses

but i did find VH 1, 2 DMG proof by converting broken codes from an armax cd.
