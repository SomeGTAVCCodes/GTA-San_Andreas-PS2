Cars Fly

UP, DOWN, L1, R1, L1, RIGHT, LEFT, L1, LEFT

But not like the old Dodo cheat. You have thrust while you're in the air, and can go faster than any airplane. Great for bookin' around the map from place to place.

 

Traffic is Fast Cars

UP, L1, R1, UP, RIGHT, UP, X, L2, X, L1

Sports cars, hot cars and rare cars. No more searching for a good ride when you need one.

 

Full Weapon Aiming While Driving

UP, UP, SQUARE, L2, RIGHT, X, R1, DOWN, R2, CIRCLE

This is so cool! You can aim and shoot anywhere with the right stick while you're driving, just like your homies do when you're doing a gang drive-by. CJ even hangs out the window to shoot over the roof. Use L2 and R2 to drive slowly. As a bonus, if you drive a motorcycle, you can't fall off!

 

Taxis Have Nitrous and L3 Bunny Hop

UP, X, TRIANGLE, X, TRIANGLE, X, SQUARE, R2, RIGHT

Without doing the Taxi missions.

 

Reduced Traffic

X, DOWN, UP, R2, DOWN, TRIANGLE, L1, TRIANGLE, LEFT

No peds and only an occasional car on the street. Parked cars still spawn. Great for cruising.

 

Orange Sky and Time Stopped at 21:00

LEFT, LEFT, L2, R1, RIGHT, SQUARE, SQUARE, L1, L2, X

Just like those early preview screens Rockstar released. It's 21:00 forever, so rob all the houses you want.

 

Gangs Rule the Streets

L2, UP, R1, R1, LEFT, R1, R1, R2, RIGHT, DOWN

Streets deserted except for gunmen fighting in the streets. No cops or regular citizens. No traffic except in gang territories.

 

Spawn Dozer

R2, L1, L1, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP, X, L1, LEFT

 

Infinite Oxygen

DOWN, LEFT, L1, DOWN, DOWN, R2, DOWN, L2, DOWN

 

Mega Punch

UP, LEFT, X, TRIANGLE, R1, CIRCLE, CIRCLE, CIRCLE, L2

Punches send people flying into the next block. One hit kills. Watch out, peds have it too!

 

Gang Members Everywhere

LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, LEFT, X, DOWN, UP, SQUARE, RIGHT

 

Funhouse Theme

TRIANGLE, TRIANGLE, L1, SQUARE, SQUARE, CIRCLE, SQUARE, DOWN, CIRCLE

Hotknifes, baggage handlers, tugs, hotdogs, mr whoopees, pizzaboys, bf injections, caddys, quads, go karts, mowers, and banditos. Peds are food service workers and clowns. Get goofy outfit. Most vehicles have hydraulics, including police vehicles!

 

Sandstorm

UP, DOWN, L1, L1, L2, L2, L1, L2, R1, R2

Not the same as the Foggy Weather cheat. It's bright and windy. The wind and limited visibility makes flying airplanes and helicopters more challenging.

 

Traffic is Country Vehicles

L1, L1, R1, R1, L2, L1, R2, DOWN, LEFT, UP

 

Cars Float Away When Hit

SQUARE, R2, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, L2, X

Tap any vehicle with your car and it floats up. Can be used to get above the max height limit. If you like skydiving, tap a heli and get in before it gets away and you can go as high as you want.

 

Adrenaline Mode

X, X, SQUARE, R1, L1, X, DOWN, LEFT, X

Slower gameplay and greater strength. Punch harder, send people flying with melee weapons, and shove cars around with your bare hands.

 

Recruit Anyone (9mm)

DOWN, SQUARE, UP, R2, R2, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP

Recruit anyone, up to 7 people. Recruits get a 9mm if they don't already have a weapon. To recruit someone who's attacking you, fire one bullet at them and immediately press UP.

 

Ninja Theme

X, X, DOWN, R2, L2, CIRCLE, R1, CIRCLE, SQUARE

Peds are all Asian dudes with katanas. Traffic is black PCJ-600's, and BF-400's, and FCR-900's. Even cop cars are all black. Get katana.

 

Lock Wanted Level

CIRCLE, RIGHT, CIRCLE, RIGHT, LEFT, SQUARE, TRIANGLE, UP

Wanted level never increases. Doesn't erase stars you already have.

 

Six Star Wanted Level

CIRCLE, RIGHT, CIRCLE, RIGHT, LEFT, SQUARE, X, DOWN

 

Slut Magnet

SQUARE, RIGHT, SQUARE, SQUARE, L2, X, TRIANGLE, X, TRIANGLE

You get the gimp suit and sluts chase you around with sex toys. Warning: may crash your game!

 

Never Get Hungry

SQUARE, L2, R1, TRIANGLE, UP, SQUARE, L2, UP, X

Kudos to System Error and SINZAR for figuring out what this does.

 

Always Midnight

SQUARE, L1, R1, RIGHT, X, UP, L1, LEFT, LEFT

Clock stopped at 00:00. Weird sudden weather changes. If you kill yourself, it'll stay at 12:00.

 

Recruit Anyone (Rockets)

R2, R2, R2, X, L2, L1, R2, L1, DOWN, X

Recruits get rocket launchers if they don't already have weapons.

 

Infinite Health

DOWN, X, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, R1, RIGHT, DOWN, UP, TRIANGLE

Makes you mostly bulletproof and immune to fire, punches and melee attacks. You can still be hurt by explosions, falling, getting run over, and drowning.

 

Hookers Pay You

RIGHT, L2, L2, DOWN, L2, UP, UP, L2, R2

Without doing the pimping missions. Thanks to Bone` for figuring out what this does.
